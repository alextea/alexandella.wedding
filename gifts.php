        <p>We’re really happy you can join us at our wedding and we don't expect any more. We don't have a gift list as our flat is already filled with everything we need.

        <p>For those of you that would like to mark the occasion with a gift, a contribution toward our honeymoon in Japan would be amazing!</p>

        <p>You can send us the gift <a href="http://paypal.me/alextorrance">via paypal</a>.</p>

        <p>Alternatively please consider making <a href="https://www.royalmarsden.org/special-occasion-donation">a donation to the Royal Marsden</a>.</p>

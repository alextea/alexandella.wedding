      <h1>Where</h1>

      <p>Worthing, West Sussex. Our wedding ceremony and reception take place at the Pavilion at the very end of Worthing Pier.</p>

      <h2>How to get to the ceremony</h2>

      <h3>By car</h3>

      <h3>Parking</h3>

      <p>The nearest car park is approximately 10 mins walk from the Pavilion. There is parking on the seafront but it likely to be more expensive and for short durations.</p>

      <h3>By train</h3>

      <p>If you don’t drive (like us!) the train to Worthing station takes about 1 hr 30 mins from Victoria, with direct services running every 30 minutes and costing approximately £30. The last train on a Saturday leaves at 10.15pm.</p>

      <p>The nearest airport is London Gatwick. Worthing is about an hour away by train or 50 mins by car.</p>

      <h3>Taxis</h3>

      <h1>The Ceremony</h1>

      <p>The wedding ceremony begins at 12 noon. Sorry, bit early but this was the only time left! We advise you arrive at 11.30am.</p>

      <p>The Pier and Pavilion is wheelchair accessible, but please let us know in advance if you need assistance.</p>

      <h2>Evening Reception</h2>
      
      <p>The ceremony is early in the day so we can see our evening guests sooner. We’re hoping for an amazing sunset, and to go with it we’ll be having cocktails and finger foods. There will be beers &amp; wines at the bar, and for anyone needing something stronger it will be a cash bar. The venue accepts all major credit cards apart from American Express.</p>

      <h2>No children!</h2>

      <p>It was hard for us to come to this decision but we hope everyone can understand we’re not inviting your children for safety reasons; the venue advised us that having lots of children would be stressful for everyone and dangerous. We have prepared some information on what to do with children in Worthing and we look forward to seeing your children soon on dry land!</p>

      <h1>Where to stay</h1>

      <p>Worthing is a British seaside town, there a quite a few old hotels but you will get best value per person via AirBnB. We advise you to book something soon as the town books up in peak season, and there will be several weddings in Worthing that weekend.</p>

      <p>Here are some suggestions:</p>

      <p>Anne controls lots of Air Bn B properties in Worthing, we’re staying in a few of her places https://www.airbnb.co.uk/users/show/1823947</p>

      <p>Chris has The Coriander Beach House that sleeps 12, with 6 bedrooms - ideal for a big group. Would require a taxi to and from Worthing.

      <p>Premier Inn &amp; Travelodge are right on the seafront, very near the pier and quite new. Rooms are around £90-110 per night for a double.</p>

      <p>Highly camp looking BnB with amazing Trip Advisor reviews. This is a 10 min taxi from the pier, don’t stay here if you’re planning to walk back. Someone needs to stay here though! Come on, the hosts are called Barbara and Richard! (Julia..?)</p>
